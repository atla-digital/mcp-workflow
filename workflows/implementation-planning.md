# Issue Implementation Planning

Create specific, actionable implementation plans for each categorized issue, tailored to their determined action type and requirements.

## Purpose

This step transforms issue categorization into concrete action plans that can be executed effectively, ensuring clear next steps and successful outcomes for each issue type.

## Prerequisites

- Issues categorized into appropriate action types with documented rationale
- Understanding of project development processes and infrastructure
- Knowledge of team roles, responsibilities, and capabilities
- Access to GitLab API for creating branches, MRs, and issue management

## Planning Framework

### üó£Ô∏è Discussion/Advice Issue Planning

**Planning Objectives**:
- Provide clear guidance or resolution to issue reporter
- Document decisions for future reference
- Ensure proper issue closure or follow-up actions
- Engage appropriate stakeholders for input when needed

**Action Plan Components**:
- **Response Strategy**: How to address the question or concern
- **Content Preparation**: Key points to communicate clearly
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Who to involve or notify
- **Documentation Needs**: What to document for future reference
- **Follow-up Actions**: Any subsequent steps required

**Deliverable Planning**:
- Comprehensive response comment addressing core concerns
- Clear explanation of reasoning and project context
- Links to relevant documentation or resources
- Follow-up issue creation if new work identified
- Appropriate issue closure or status updates

### üéØ Single Implementation Issue Planning

**Planning Objectives**:
- Define clear technical approach and implementation strategy
- Establish development infrastructure for efficient execution
- Create comprehensive requirements documentation
- Set up appropriate review and validation processes

**Technical Approach Planning**:
- **Architecture Assessment**: How changes fit into existing system
- **Implementation Strategy**: Step-by-step technical approach
- **Testing Strategy**: Validation and quality assurance plans
- **Integration Approach**: How changes integrate with existing code
- **Risk Mitigation**: Plans for addressing potential issues

**Infrastructure Planning**:
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branch naming and structure
- **Merge Request Setup**: MR description, labels, and reviewers
- **Development Environment**: Any special setup requirements
- **Documentation Updates**: Required documentation changes

**Resource Planning**:
- **Developer Assignment**: Who will implement the changes
- **Timeline Estimation**: Realistic implementation timeline
- **Review Process**: Code review and approval workflow
- **Testing Requirements**: Specific testing needs and criteria

### üì¶ Breakdown Issue Planning

**Planning Objectives**:
- Design logical breakdown into manageable work packages
- Establish relationships and dependencies between packages
- Create coordinated development and integration strategy
- Ensure incremental value delivery throughout process

**Breakdown Strategy**:
- **Component Analysis**: Natural breaking points and boundaries
- **Dependency Mapping**: Relationships between work packages
- **Integration Planning**: How components combine into final solution
- **Risk Assessment**: Risks specific to distributed development
- **Value Delivery**: How to deliver incremental value

**Work Package Definition**:
- **Package Scope**: Clear boundaries for each work package
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific success measures for each package
- **Interface Definitions**: How packages interact with each other
- **Testing Strategy**: Individual and integration testing approach
- **Documentation Approach**: Documentation for each component

**Coordination Planning**:
- **Development Sequencing**: Order and timing of work packages
- **Team Assignment**: Developer allocation across packages
- **Communication Strategy**: Coordination and status updates
- **Integration Timeline**: When and how packages are combined
- **Quality Gates**: Validation points throughout process

### üîç Investigation Issue Planning

**Planning Objectives**:
- Define specific research questions and objectives
- Identify information sources and investigation methods
- Plan stakeholder engagement and input collection
- Establish clear criteria for investigation completion

**Research Planning**:
- **Investigation Scope**: Specific questions to be answered
- **Research Methods**: How information will be gathered
- **Information Sources**: Where to find needed information
- **Timeline**: Realistic timeframe for investigation
- **Success Criteria**: How to know investigation is complete

**Stakeholder Engagement**:
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Who needs to provide input
- **Engagement Strategy**: How to collect stakeholder input
- **Communication Plan**: How to keep stakeholders informed
- **Decision Timeline**: When decisions need to be made
- **Escalation Path**: How to handle disagreements or delays

## Planning Quality Standards

### Comprehensive Planning

**Ensure each plan includes**:
- Clear objectives and success criteria
- Specific actions and deliverables
- Resource requirements and assignments
- Timeline and milestone definitions
- Quality assurance and validation approach
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Actionable Detail

**Verify plans provide**:
- Specific, actionable steps that can be executed
- Clear acceptance criteria and quality gates
- Appropriate level of detail for complexity
- Integration with existing project processes
- Realistic resource and timeline estimates

### Consistency and Alignment

**Confirm plans maintain**:
- Consistency with project standards and practices
- Alignment with overall project priorities
- Appropriate resource allocation and scheduling
- Integration with existing development workflows
- Proper risk management and quality assurance

## Documentation Standards

### Plan Documentation

**For each issue, document comprehensive plan including**:
- **Objective Statement**: Clear goal for this issue
- **Action Strategy**: Specific approach and methodology
- **Deliverables**: Concrete outputs and completion criteria
- **Resource Requirements**: Time, skills, and tools needed
- **Timeline**: Realistic schedule with key milestones
- **Quality Criteria**: Standards and validation requirements
- **Risk Considerations**: Potential challenges and mitigation

### Execution Readiness

**Ensure plans provide sufficient detail for**:
- Immediate execution without additional planning
- Clear understanding of expected outcomes
- Appropriate quality and validation standards
- Integration with project workflows and standards
- Effective communication with stakeholders

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Complete when you have**:
- Created detailed, actionable plans for all categorized issues
- Ensured plans are appropriate for each issue category and complexity
- Documented clear objectives, approaches, and success criteria
- Validated resource requirements and timeline estimates
- Prepared plans that enable immediate execution
- Aligned plans with project standards and priorities

## Next Steps

**If all implementation plans complete and validated** ‚Üí Return to main workflow for execution and documentation

**If plans need stakeholder validation** ‚Üí Review with appropriate team members or stakeholders before execution

**If resource or timeline concerns identified** ‚Üí Adjust plans or seek additional resources before proceeding
