# Deep Issue Analysis

Perform comprehensive analysis of selected issues to fully understand requirements, assess complexity, and prepare for appropriate action planning.

## Purpose

This step ensures thorough understanding of each selected issue before categorizing and planning implementation approaches, preventing misunderstandings and scope creep later in the development process.

## Prerequisites

- Issues selected from discovery process
- GitLab API access for detailed issue retrieval
- Understanding of project technical architecture
- Knowledge of team capabilities and constraints

## Analysis Process

### Detailed Issue Examination

**For each selected issue, gather comprehensive information**:

**Issue Details**:
- Use `gitlab_get_issue` to get complete issue information
- Review title, description, and all comments thoroughly
- Examine labels, assignees, and milestone information
- Check creation date and recent activity patterns

**Relationship Analysis**:
- Use `gitlab_list_issue_links` to identify dependencies
- Check for parent/child relationships with other issues
- Identify blocking or blocked-by relationships
- Map connections to other work packages or features

**Stakeholder Context**:
- Identify issue reporter and any assigned stakeholders
- Review comment threads for additional context
- Note any domain expert input or technical guidance
- Understand business sponsor or user impact

### Requirement Assessment

**Problem Statement Analysis**:
- Extract core problem being solved
- Identify root cause vs. symptoms
- Understand user impact and business value
- Clarify success criteria and acceptance conditions

**Technical Scope Evaluation**:
- Estimate complexity based on system knowledge
- Identify affected components and integration points
- Assess potential for breaking changes or regressions
- Consider testing requirements and validation needs

**Resource Requirements**:
- Estimate development effort required
- Identify skills and expertise needed
- Consider dependencies on other team members
- Assess timeline constraints and priorities

### Risk and Complexity Assessment

**Technical Risks**:
- Identify potential implementation challenges
- Consider architectural implications
- Assess compatibility with existing systems
- Evaluate performance or security considerations

**Business Risks**:
- Understand impact of delayed implementation
- Consider user experience implications
- Assess market or competitive factors
- Identify compliance or regulatory considerations

**Complexity Indicators**:
- Multiple system integration points
- Cross-team coordination requirements
- Significant architectural changes needed
- High performance or security requirements
- Complex business logic or validation rules

## Documentation Standards

### Analysis Documentation

**For each analyzed issue, document**:
- **Problem Summary**: Clear statement of core issue
- **Business Impact**: User benefit and business value
- **Technical Approach**: High-level implementation strategy  
- **Complexity Assessment**: Size, risk, and resource estimates
- **Dependencies**: Related issues, systems, or team dependencies
- **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of completion
- **Risks and Considerations**: Potential challenges or concerns

### Quality Validation

**Ensure analysis includes**:
- Clear understanding of problem and solution approach
- Realistic complexity and effort assessment
- Identification of major dependencies or blockers
- Understanding of business value and priority
- Clear success criteria and acceptance conditions

## Success Criteria

✅ **Complete when you have**:
- Thoroughly analyzed all selected issues using consistent methodology
- Documented comprehensive understanding of requirements and complexity
- Identified dependencies, risks, and resource requirements
- Established clear success criteria for each issue
- Prepared sufficient information for accurate categorization and planning

## Next Steps

**If all issues analyzed thoroughly** → Return to main workflow for action categorization

**If issues need clarification** → Add comments requesting clarification, then continue analysis process

**If critical dependencies discovered** → Document dependencies and factor into categorization decisions
