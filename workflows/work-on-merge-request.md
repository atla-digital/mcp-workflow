# GitLab Merge Request Implementation Workflow

Handle both initial implementation and review feedback implementation using KISS principles (Keep It Simple, Smart). This workflow adapts based on your current merge request state.

## Workflow Overview

### Key Scenarios This Workflow Handles

**Happy Path**: Clear requirements, smooth implementation, and successful pipeline validation
- Well-defined acceptance criteria with clear technical approach
- Implementation proceeds incrementally with all tests passing
- Code review feedback is constructive and easily addressable
- All quality gates pass and MR merges successfully

**Error Paths**: Implementation challenges, pipeline failures, or review complications
- Requirements unclear or conflicting, requiring clarification
- Pipeline failures requiring debugging and resolution
- Complex review feedback requiring significant rework
- Technical blockers or dependency issues preventing progress

**Alternative Paths**: Different development scenarios requiring adapted approaches
- Emergency fixes requiring expedited process
- Large features requiring iterative development approach
- Legacy code integration requiring special handling
- Cross-team coordination for complex changes

**Edge Cases**: Unusual scenarios requiring special handling
- Breaking changes requiring careful coordination and communication
- Performance-critical implementations requiring specialized testing
- Security-sensitive changes requiring additional validation
- Rollback scenarios requiring careful state management

### Implementation Scenarios

This workflow supports different implementation scenarios:
- **Initial Implementation**: Simple, focused implementation solving the core problem
- **Review Response**: Direct implementation of specific review suggestions
- **Iterative Development**: Small, incremental improvements with pipeline validation

**Focus**: Solve the immediate problem with the simplest working solution.

## Prerequisites

- Access to GitLab project with development permissions
- Local development environment properly configured
- Git repository with appropriate branch setup
- Understanding of project conventions and testing requirements

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Environment Verification & Context Discovery

**Purpose**: Establish your current development context and verify environment readiness.

**Actions**:
- Verify you're on correct feature branch (not main/master)
- Ensure working directory is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Get git remote URL and use `gitlab_get_project_id` to get project_id
- Check current branch name for MR association context
- Use `gitlab_list_merge_requests` with source_branch to find existing MR
- Verify local development environment and dependencies

**Success Criteria**:
- Development environment verified and ready
- Project context established with project_id
- Current branch context understood
- Existing MR status determined

**Next Steps**:
**If environment ready and context established** → Continue to @current-state-analysis@

**If environment issues found** → Follow development environment recovery procedure:
1. Verify Node.js/Python/language runtime versions match project requirements
2. Clear and reinstall dependencies (`npm ci`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, etc.)
3. Check for conflicting global packages or environment variables
4. Verify database connections and required services are running
5. Test build process to ensure compilation succeeds
6. Run test suite to verify environment stability
7. If issues persist, consult project-specific setup documentation
8. Once environment verified, return to this step

**If GitLab access issues** → Follow GitLab API troubleshooting procedure:
1. Verify personal access token validity and scopes
2. Test basic API connectivity with `gitlab_get_current_user`
3. Check project permissions (minimum Developer access usually required)
4. Verify network connectivity and firewall settings
5. Try accessing GitLab web interface to confirm service availability
6. If using self-hosted GitLab, check with system administrator
7. Document working access token and project ID for future reference
8. Once access restored, return to this step

**If branch or git issues found** → Follow git troubleshooting procedure:
1. Check current branch with `git branch` - ensure not on main/master
2. Verify working directory is clean with `git status`
3. If uncommitted changes exist, stash or commit them appropriately
4. Check remote connectivity with `git remote -v`
5. Sync with remote using `git fetch` and resolve any conflicts
6. Create or switch to appropriate feature branch
7. Ensure branch naming follows project conventions
8. Once git state is clean and correct, return to this step

### 2. Current State Analysis

**Purpose**: Understand current implementation state and determine appropriate workflow path.

**Actions**:
- If MR exists: Use `gitlab_get_merge_request` to understand current state
- If MR exists: Use `gitlab_get_merge_request_changes` to see implemented changes
- Review existing discussions: Use `gitlab_list_merge_request_discussions`
- Check CI/CD pipeline status: Use `gitlab_list_pipelines`
- Assess local vs remote code differences
- Review any issue requirements if working from issues

**Success Criteria**:
- Current implementation state fully understood
- Existing feedback and discussions reviewed
- Pipeline status assessed
- Workflow path determined

**Next Steps**:
**If no MR exists or minimal implementation** → Continue to @initial-implementation@

**If MR exists with review feedback** → Continue to @review-response-implementation@

**If ongoing iterative development** → Continue to @iterative-development@

### 3. Initial Implementation

**Purpose**: Implement core functionality for new features or fixes using simple, focused approach.

**Prerequisites**:
- Requirements clearly understood from issue or specification
- Development environment ready for implementation

**Actions**:
- Read existing codebase files to understand patterns and conventions
- Identify MINIMAL files and components needing modification
- Choose simplest approach that solves the core problem
- Break implementation into 3-6 logical, incremental steps
- For each step:
  - Implement one logical piece only
  - Test locally (run tests, builds, linting)
  - Commit with descriptive message
  - Push to remote branch
  - Wait for CI/CD pipeline completion (sleep 60-100 seconds between checks)
  - Fix any pipeline failures immediately
- Use existing patterns instead of creating new architectures
- Add basic validation and error handling without over-engineering

**Success Criteria**:
- Core functionality implemented and working
- All local tests pass before any commits
- All CI/CD pipelines pass successfully

## Implementation Guidelines

### Iterative Development Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Never implement everything in one large commit. Break work into logical steps:**

**Step Planning**:
- Identify 3-6 logical implementation steps
- Each step independently testable
- Each step adds value without breaking functionality
- Example progression:
  - Step 1: Add basic data model/interface
  - Step 2: Implement core functionality
  - Step 3: Add input validation
  - Step 4: Add error handling
  - Step 5: Add comprehensive tests
  - Step 6: Update documentation

**Commit/Push/Check Cycle (Per Step)**:
1. **Implement**: One logical piece only (not everything)
2. **Test Locally**: Run tests, builds, linting for this step
3. **Commit**: Descriptive message explaining this specific step
4. **Push**: To remote branch
5. **Wait**: 60-100 seconds for pipeline completion
6. **Verify**: Pipeline success before next step
7. **Fix if Failed**: Debug and repeat cycle for this step
8. **Next Step**: Only after current step succeeds

### Quality Standards (All Paths)

**Local Testing Requirements (CRITICAL)**:
- All tests MUST pass locally before any commits
- Run comprehensive test suite using project commands
- Verify static analysis and linting passes
- Ensure code compiles/builds successfully
- Test functionality works as expected
- Check for performance regressions

**Pipeline Management**:
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline after every push
- Wait for completion before proceeding (60-100 seconds between checks)
- Fix failures immediately and repeat cycle
- Implementation NOT complete until pipeline succeeds

### Communication Standards

**Commit Messages**:
- Use conventional commit format with clear descriptions
- Reference specific functionality being implemented
- Include context explaining the change

**MR Documentation**:
- Comprehensive description of implementation approach
- Clear acceptance criteria verification
- Testing strategy and coverage details
- Any design decisions or trade-offs made

**Review Response**:
- Specific replies to each discussion point
- Implementation details and reasoning
- Thank reviewers for valuable feedback
- Clear resolution of suggested changes

## Success Criteria
