# Documentation & Finalization Phase

Complete your workflow by adding comprehensive documentation, finalizing metadata, and preparing it for deployment and maintenance.

## Metadata Completion

### Frontmatter Requirements
Ensure every workflow file has complete frontmatter:

**Required Fields:**
```yaml
---
title: "Clear, Descriptive Title"
description: "Brief description of what this step accomplishes"
---
```

**Optional Fields for Entrypoints:**
```yaml
---
entrypoint: true
title: "Workflow Name"
description: "Complete workflow description"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "Creator name"
tags: ["category", "type", "domain"]
last_updated: "2024-01-15"
---
```

### Step Documentation Standards

**Title Guidelines:**
- Use descriptive, action-oriented titles
- Keep consistent with step content
- Make titles scannable in lists

**Description Guidelines:**
- Summarize the step's purpose in 1-2 sentences
- Focus on outcome, not process
- Use consistent language across related steps

## Workflow-Level Documentation

### Create a Workflow Overview
For complex workflows, consider creating a summary document:

```markdown
# Workflow: [Name]

## Purpose
What this workflow accomplishes and when to use it.

## Prerequisites  
What must be in place before starting.

## Overview of Steps
High-level summary of the workflow phases.

## Success Criteria
How to know the workflow completed successfully.

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and their resolution.
```

### Document Decision Points
Create reference material for complex branching:

```markdown
## Decision Matrix

| Condition | Criteria | Next Step | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Tests Pass | Exit code 0, >80% coverage | `@deploy@` | Ready for deployment |
| Tests Fail | Exit code ≠ 0 | `@debug-tests@` | Must fix before deploy |
| Coverage Low | <80% coverage | `@improve-coverage@` | Quality gate |
```

## Integration Documentation

### API and Tool Dependencies
Document external requirements:
- Required tools and their versions
- API endpoints and authentication
- File system paths and permissions
- Environment variables and configuration

### Cross-Workflow References
If your workflow integrates with others:
- Document handoff points
- Specify data formats and expectations
- Define error handling contracts
- Map shared step references

## Maintenance Documentation

### Version Control Strategy
- Tag workflow versions for reference
- Document breaking changes
- Maintain backward compatibility notes
- Plan migration paths for updates

### Change Management Process
```markdown
## Workflow Change Process

1. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate affected workflows and users
2. **Testing**: Validate changes against test scenarios  
3. **Documentation**: Update all affected documentation
4. **Communication**: Notify workflow users of changes
5. **Deployment**: Roll out changes with rollback plan
6. **Monitoring**: Verify changes work as expected
```

### Usage Analytics Planning
Consider how you'll track workflow effectiveness:
- Success/failure rates by path
- Common failure points
- User feedback collection
- Performance metrics

## Quality Assurance

### Final Review Checklist

**Content Quality**
- [ ] All steps have clear, actionable instructions
- [ ] Branching conditions are specific and measurable
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Examples are provided for complex concepts
- [ ] Language is consistent across all steps

**Technical Quality**
- [ ] All `@step-id@` references are valid (**CRITICAL**: Run `workflow_find_invalid_links` to verify)
- [ ] No orphaned or unreachable steps (Run `workflow_find_orphans` to verify)
- [ ] Frontmatter is complete and consistent
- [ ] File naming follows conventions
- [ ] No circular dependencies

**⚠️ Validation Tools Required:**
Before marking technical quality as complete, you MUST run:
```
workflow_find_invalid_links
```
This should return **zero invalid references**. Any invalid links must be fixed before deployment.

```
workflow_find_orphans  
```
Review any reported orphans to ensure they are intentional (not accidental dead-ends).

**User Experience**
- [ ] Workflow purpose is clear from the entrypoint
- [ ] Navigation is intuitive and well-signposted
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Success criteria are explicit
- [ ] Appropriate level of detail for target audience

**Documentation Quality**
- [ ] All decision criteria are documented
- [ ] Dependencies and prerequisites are clear
- [ ] Troubleshooting guidance is provided
- [ ] Version information is current
- [ ] Contact information for support

### Peer Review Process
Before finalizing:
1. **Technical review**: Have someone check logic and references
2. **Content review**: Get feedback on clarity and completeness
3. **User testing**: Have target users try the workflow
4. **Expert review**: Get domain expert validation of approach

## Deployment Preparation

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All files are in correct locations
- [ ] File permissions are appropriate
- [ ] Dependencies are installed and configured
- [ ] Test environment validates successfully
- [ ] Rollback plan is prepared
- [ ] Monitoring is in place

### Launch Communication
Prepare materials for workflow users:
- Announcement of new workflow availability
- Training materials if needed
- Support contacts and escalation paths
- Feedback collection mechanisms

### Post-Launch Monitoring
Plan for ongoing workflow health:
- Success rate monitoring
- User feedback collection
- Performance metric tracking
- Identification of improvement opportunities

## Success Criteria for This Step

✅ **Complete when you have:**
- All files have complete, accurate metadata
- Comprehensive documentation covers all aspects
- Quality assurance checklist is fully satisfied
- Peer review feedback is incorporated
- Deployment checklist is completed
- Launch and monitoring plans are ready

## Workflow Completion

**Congratulations!** You have successfully created a comprehensive workflow following best practices for:

- ✅ Thorough planning and requirements gathering
