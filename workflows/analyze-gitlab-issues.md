# GitLab Issue Analysis Workflow

Systematically analyze GitLab issues to determine the most appropriate course of action using KISS principles (Keep It Simple, Smart).

## Workflow Overview

### Key Scenarios This Workflow Handles

**Happy Path**: Issues are well-defined, properly categorized, and development infrastructure created efficiently
- Clear problem statements with defined acceptance criteria
- Straightforward categorization into single implementation approach
- Smooth development infrastructure creation with proper documentation
- Successful stakeholder communication and project tracking

**Error Paths**: Issues are unclear, stakeholders unavailable, or technical blockers exist
- Vague or conflicting requirements requiring clarification
- GitLab API access issues or permission problems
- Missing stakeholder input for critical decisions
- Technical dependencies that block progress

**Alternative Paths**: Different analysis outcomes requiring different approaches
- Discussion-only resolution without code changes
- Complex issues requiring breakdown into work packages
- Investigation needed before implementation can begin
- Priority changes affecting analysis recommendations

**Edge Cases**: Unusual scenarios requiring special handling
- Legacy issues with incomplete historical context
- Cross-project dependencies requiring coordination
- Emergency issues requiring expedited process
- Invalid or duplicate issues requiring careful closure

### Analysis Outcomes

This analysis can lead to different outcomes:
- **No Action Needed**: Issue resolved through discussion or closing as invalid
- **Ready for Single Implementation**: Well-defined issue addressable in one focused approach (PREFERRED)
- **Needs Breakdown**: Large issue requiring split into smaller work packages
- **Further Investigation**: Issue needs more research or stakeholder input

**Default Approach**: Recommend single implementation when possible. Only suggest breakdown if absolutely necessary.

## Prerequisites

- Access to GitLab project with appropriate permissions
- Understanding of project context and requirements
- Git repository properly configured

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Project Context Discovery

**Purpose**: Establish your current GitLab project context and authentication.

**Actions**:
- Get git remote URL from your repository
- Use `gitlab_get_project_id` with the remote URL to get project_id
- Verify GitLab API access and permissions
- Check current branch context if applicable

**Success Criteria**:
- Project ID obtained and validated
- GitLab API connectivity confirmed
- Current git context understood

**Next Steps**:
**If project context established successfully** ‚Üí Continue to @issue-discovery@

**If authentication or access issues** ‚Üí Follow GitLab API troubleshooting procedure:
1. Verify GitLab personal access token is valid and has appropriate scopes
2. Check network connectivity to GitLab instance
3. Confirm user has at least Reporter access to target project
4. Test API access with simple call like `gitlab_get_current_user`
5. If issues persist, escalate to GitLab administrator
6. Once resolved, return to this step

**If project not found** ‚Üí Follow project discovery procedure:
1. Verify git remote URL format and accessibility
2. Check if repository has been moved, renamed, or archived
3. Confirm user has access to the specific project
4. Try accessing project through GitLab web interface to verify existence
5. If project exists but not accessible, request appropriate permissions
6. Once access confirmed, return to this step

**If project ID extraction fails** ‚Üí Manual project identification:
1. Navigate to project in GitLab web interface
2. Extract project ID from project settings or URL
3. Verify project ID works with `gitlab_get_project` call
4. Document correct project ID for future reference
5. Continue to @issue-discovery@

### 2. Issue Discovery & Selection

**Purpose**: Identify and select 1-3 promising issues for deeper analysis.

**Actions**:
- Use `gitlab_list_issues` with project_id and state="opened"
- Review issue titles, labels, and basic descriptions
- Filter by priority, assignee, or labels if needed
- Select 1-3 issues that appear suitable for analysis
- Consider business impact and complexity indicators

**Success Criteria**:
- Specific issues identified for analysis
- Issues appear well-suited for development work
- Selection covers different complexity levels if multiple chosen

**Next Steps**:
**If suitable issues identified** ‚Üí Continue to @deep-issue-analysis@

**If no suitable issues found** ‚Üí Check issue filters, labels, or expand search criteria

**If too many issues available** ‚Üí Apply more specific filters or focus on highest priority items

### 3. Deep Issue Analysis

**Purpose**: Conduct thorough analysis of each selected issue to understand requirements and complexity.

**Actions**:
For each selected issue:
- Use `gitlab_get_issue` to get complete issue details
- Use `gitlab_list_issue_links` to check existing relationships
- Analyze problem statement and acceptance criteria
- Assess technical complexity and scope
- Evaluate business impact and priority
- Check for existing comments and discussion threads
- Identify any blockers or dependencies

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete understanding of each issue's requirements
- Complexity and scope assessed for each issue
- Dependencies and relationships identified
- Business impact evaluated

**Next Steps**:
**If all issues analyzed thoroughly** ‚Üí Continue to @action-categorization@

**If issues need clarification** ‚Üí Add comments requesting clarification, then continue analysis

**If critical dependencies found** ‚Üí Document dependencies and factor into categorization

### 4. Action Categorization

**Purpose**: Categorize each analyzed issue into appropriate action types.

**Decision Criteria**:

**üó£Ô∏è Discussion/Advice Only**:
- Issue needs clarification or guidance
- Problem solvable without code changes
- Invalid, duplicate, or out-of-scope issues

**üéØ Ready for Single Implementation**:

- Clear scope and acceptance criteria
- Addressable in one cohesive solution
- Estimated effort ‚â§ 2 weeks

**üì¶ Needs Breakdown**:
- Large, complex issue (>2 weeks effort)
- Multiple independent components
- High-risk changes needing isolation
- Multiple developers required simultaneously

**üîç Further Investigation**:
- Requirements unclear or incomplete
- Technical approach uncertain
- Stakeholder input required

**Next Steps**:
**If all issues categorized** ‚Üí Continue to @implementation-planning@

## Quality Guidelines

### Issue Evaluation Criteria (KISS First)
- **Clarity**: Is the problem well-defined?
- **Simplicity**: Can this be solved with a direct approach?
- **Scope**: How large is the change? (Prefer smaller, focused changes)
- **Priority**: What's the business impact?
- **Dependencies**: Are there related issues or blockers?
- **Feasibility**: Is the change practical with minimal complexity?

### When to Break Down Issues (Use Sparingly)
- **Size**: Issue genuinely requires >2 weeks of work
- **Risk**: High-risk changes needing isolation
- **Dependencies**: Blocking relationships preventing single implementation
- **Team**: Multiple developers must work simultaneously

### Quality Standards (Lean Approach)
- Favor single, focused solutions over multiple work packages
- Minimal viable implementation solving core problem
- Clear acceptance criteria without over-specification
- Use issue links only when genuine dependencies exist
- Strategic focus on "what" and "why", avoid over-architecting

## Success Criteria
