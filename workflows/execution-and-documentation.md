# Issue Execution and Documentation

Execute the specific action plans created for each categorized issue and properly document all results and outcomes in GitLab.

## Purpose

This step implements the planned actions for each issue category, ensuring proper execution and comprehensive documentation of results for stakeholder visibility and project tracking.

## Prerequisites

- Detailed implementation plans prepared for all categorized issues

   - Provide specific guidance, examples, or references as needed
   - Link to relevant documentation, standards, or related issues

2. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - Use `gitlab_update_issue` to add comprehensive response comment
   - Tag relevant stakeholders using @mentions for input when needed
   - Request specific feedback or validation if required
   - Schedule follow-up discussions if complex decisions needed

3. **Issue Resolution**:
   - Update issue status appropriately (close if resolved)
   - Add resolution summary explaining outcome and reasoning
   - Create follow-up issues if new work identified during discussion
   - Update labels to reflect current status and categorization

4. **Documentation and Follow-up**:
   - Ensure all guidance is documented clearly for future reference
   - Link to or create relevant documentation updates if needed

     - Detailed problem statement and solution approach
     - Clear acceptance criteria and definition of done
     - Testing strategy and quality requirements
     - Links to related issues and documentation

3. **Process Setup**:
   - Add appropriate labels for categorization and tracking
   - Assign to appropriate developer or leave unassigned for team pickup
   - Set up proper reviewers and approval workflow
   - Link MR back to original issue with clear references

4. **Documentation and Communication**:
   - Update issue comments with links to created development infrastructure
   - Communicate readiness for development to appropriate team members
   - Ensure all necessary context is preserved in GitLab for developer reference
   - Document any special considerations or requirements

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete development infrastructure created and properly configured
- Comprehensive documentation provided for developer reference
- Clear links established between issue, branch, and merge request
- Ready for immediate development work with all context preserved

### üì¶ Breakdown Issue Execution

**Execution Objectives**:
- Create logical breakdown into well-defined work packages
- Establish proper relationships and dependencies between packages
- Create complete development infrastructure for coordinated development
- Document integration approach and coordination strategy

**Execution Steps**:

1. **Original Issue Documentation**:
   - Use `gitlab_update_issue` to add breakdown explanation and strategy
   - Document rationale for breakdown and coordination approach
   - Explain how work packages integrate into complete solution
   - Provide timeline and resource estimates for overall effort

2. **Work Package Creation**:
   - Use `gitlab_create_issue` for each logical work package with:
     - Clear scope and boundaries for the package
     - Specific acceptance criteria and success measures
     - Interface definitions and integration requirements
     - Testing and quality requirements

3. **Relationship Establishment**:
   - Use `gitlab_create_issue_link` to establish proper relationships:
     - Parent/child relationships between original issue and packages
     - Blocking relationships where dependencies exist
     - Related links for packages that share components
   - Use `gitlab_list_issue_links` to verify relationships properly established

4. **Development Infrastructure Setup**:
   - For each work package:
     - Use `gitlab_create_branch` for dedicated feature branch
     - Use `gitlab_create_merge_request` with detailed package description
     - Link MR to respective sub-issue with proper references
     - Set up appropriate labels, reviewers, and assignments

5. **Coordination Documentation**:
   - Document integration strategy and coordination requirements
   - Comment on original issue with links to all work packages
   - Establish communication plan for package coordination
   - Plan integration timeline and validation approach

**Success Criteria**:
- Logical breakdown completed with well-defined work packages
- All relationships properly established and documented
- Complete development infrastructure created for each package
- Clear coordination and integration strategy documented
