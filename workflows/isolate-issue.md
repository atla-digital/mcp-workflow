# Isolate the Issue

Use systematic elimination to narrow down the problem:

## Isolation Techniques

1. **Binary search approach**: Disable half the features/components
2. **Minimal reproduction**: Create the smallest case that shows the problem
3. **Environment comparison**: Test in different environments
4. **Data analysis**: Check if specific data triggers the issue

## Next Steps

- If you've isolated the component → @analyze-errors@
- If you need to examine code → @code-review@
- If it's environment-specific → @check-environment@
