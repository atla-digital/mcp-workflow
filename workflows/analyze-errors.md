# Analyze Error Messages

When you have clear error messages to work with:

## Error Analysis Steps

1. **Read the full error**: Don't just look at the first line
2. **Check stack trace**: Follow the execution path
3. **Look for patterns**: Are there common elements across errors?
4. **Research the error**: Search documentation and known issues

## Next Actions

- If you've identified the root cause → @implement-fix@
- If you need more context → @gather-context@
- If the error is unclear → @isolate-issue@
