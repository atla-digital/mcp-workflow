# Current State Analysis

Understand the current state of your merge request and development context to determine the most appropriate implementation workflow path.

## Purpose

This step ensures you have complete understanding of existing work, feedback, and context before choosing between initial implementation, review response, or iterative development approaches.

## Prerequisites

- Environment verified and GitLab project context established
- Current branch and potential merge request identified
- Access to GitLab API for MR and discussion retrieval

## Analysis Process

### Merge Request State Assessment

**If Merge Request Exists**:
- Use `gitlab_get_merge_request` to understand current purpose and scope
- Review MR description for completeness and accuracy
- Check current status (draft, ready for review, approved, etc.)
- Assess alignment between MR description and actual implementation

**Implementation Status Evaluation**:
- Use `gitlab_get_merge_request_changes` to see all current modifications
- Review file-by-file changes to understand implementation progress
- Assess code quality and completeness of existing implementation
- Identify any incomplete or placeholder implementations

### Feedback and Discussion Review

**Existing Feedback Analysis**:
- Use `gitlab_list_merge_request_discussions` to review all feedback
- Categorize feedback by type (bugs, improvements, suggestions, questions)
- Assess feedback urgency and implementation complexity
- Identify resolved vs. unresolved discussion threads

**Review Progress Assessment**:
- Check which discussions have been addressed
- Identify outstanding reviewer concerns or suggestions
- Assess any new feedback since last development activity
- Understand reviewer expectations and approval criteria

### Pipeline and Quality Status

**CI/CD Pipeline Assessment**:
- Use `gitlab_list_pipelines` to check recent pipeline status
- Review any failing tests, builds, or quality checks
- Assess pipeline stability and consistency
- Identify any infrastructure or dependency issues

**Code Quality Status**:
- Review any automated code quality reports
- Check test coverage and testing adequacy
- Assess adherence to project coding standards
- Identify any security or performance concerns raised

### Development Context Analysis

**Local vs Remote State**:
- Compare local working directory with remote branch state
- Identify any uncommitted changes or work in progress
- Assess synchronization between local and remote development
- Check for any conflicts or merge issues

**Requirements and Scope Understanding**:
- Review original issue or feature requirements if applicable
- Assess current implementation against acceptance criteria
- Identify any scope changes or requirement evolution
- Understand business priority and timeline expectations

## Path Determination Framework

### Initial Implementation Path Indicators

**Choose this path when**:
- No MR exists yet for the current work
- MR exists but has minimal or placeholder implementation
- Starting fresh feature development from requirements
- Previous implementation needs complete restart

**Characteristics**:
- Focus on core feature development from requirements
- Comprehensive implementation strategy needed
- Development infrastructure may need creation
- Primary focus on building functionality

### Review Response Path Indicators

**Choose this path when**:
- MR exists with substantial implementation complete
- Active reviewer feedback and discussion threads present
- Clear, specific suggestions for improvement identified
- Implementation is largely correct but needs refinement

**Characteristics**:
- Focus on implementing specific reviewer suggestions
- Addressing feedback systematically with clear responses
- Improving existing implementation rather than building new
- Communication and discussion resolution emphasis

### Iterative Development Path Indicators

**Choose this path when**:
- MR exists with partial implementation in progress
- Ongoing development with periodic feedback incorporation
- Complex feature requiring incremental development approach
- Balancing new development with ongoing review feedback

**Characteristics**:
- Continue development while addressing feedback
- Incremental progress with regular validation
- Balance between new features and improvement implementation
- Ongoing coordination between development and review cycles

## Decision Documentation

### Path Selection Rationale

**Document decision reasoning including**:
- Current state assessment summary
- Key factors influencing path selection
- Expected outcomes and approach for chosen path
- Any special considerations or constraints
- Timeline and resource implications

### Context Preservation

**Ensure comprehensive context documentation**:
- Current implementation status and progress
- Outstanding feedback and discussion summary
- Pipeline status and quality issues
- Requirements understanding and scope clarity
- Development environment and dependency status

## Success Criteria

✅ **Complete when you have**:
- Thoroughly analyzed current MR state and implementation status
- Reviewed all existing feedback and discussions comprehensively
- Assessed pipeline status and code quality indicators
- Understood development context and requirements clearly
- Selected appropriate workflow path with clear rationale
- Documented decision reasoning and context for future reference
