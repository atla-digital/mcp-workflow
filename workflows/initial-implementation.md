# Initial Implementation

Implement core functionality for new features or fixes using KISS principles with systematic, iterative development approach.

## Purpose

This step focuses on building functionality from requirements using the simplest effective approach, breaking work into logical increments for continuous validation and quality assurance.

## Prerequisites

- Requirements clearly understood from issue or specification
- Development environment ready and verified
- Project context and coding standards understood
- GitLab project access established

## Implementation Strategy

### Requirements Analysis (Keep Simple)

**Focus on Core Problem**:
- Identify the essential problem being solved
- Extract minimal requirements that satisfy acceptance criteria
- Avoid feature creep or nice-to-have additions
- Choose simplest approach that solves the core issue

**Technical Approach Planning**:
- Read existing codebase files to understand patterns
- Identify MINIMAL files and components needing modification
- Choose existing patterns instead of creating new architectures
- Plan for basic validation and error handling (avoid over-engineering)

### Iterative Implementation Process

**Step Planning (CRITICAL)**:
Break implementation into 3-6 logical, incremental steps:
- Step 1: Add basic data model/interface
- Step 2: Implement core functionality
- Step 3: Add input validation
- Step 4: Add error handling
- Step 5: Add comprehensive tests
- Step 6: Update documentation

**Implementation Cycle (Per Step)**:
1. **Implement**: One logical piece only (not everything at once)
2. **Test Locally**: Run tests, builds, linting for this specific step
3. **Commit**: Descriptive message explaining this specific step
4. **Push**: To remote branch
5. **Wait**: 60-100 seconds for CI/CD pipeline completion
6. **Verify**: Pipeline success before proceeding to next step
7. **Fix if Failed**: Debug issues and repeat cycle for this step only
8. **Next Step**: Only proceed after current step succeeds completely

### Code Quality Standards

**Local Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)**:
- All tests MUST pass locally before any commits
- Run comprehensive test suite using project commands
- Verify static analysis and linting passes
- Ensure code compiles/builds successfully
- Test new functionality works in various scenarios
- Check for regressions in existing functionality

**Implementation Quality**:
- Follow existing project conventions consistently
- Use established patterns instead of inventing new ones
- Implement appropriate error handling (not excessive)
- Add clear comments for complex business logic only
- Maintain clean, readable, maintainable code structure

## Pipeline Management

### Continuous Validation

**Pipeline Monitoring (CRITICAL)**:
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline status after every push
- Use `gitlab_list_pipelines` to check recent pipeline status
- Sleep 60-100 seconds between pipeline status checks
- Use `gitlab_get_pipeline` to verify completion status
- Continue checking until pipeline reaches final state

**Failure Response**:
- Debug failures using `gitlab_get_pipeline_jobs` and `gitlab_get_job_log`
- Fix issues immediately and completely
- Re-run the full implementation cycle for the failed step
- Never proceed to next step until current step pipeline succeeds
- **Implementation is NOT complete until all pipelines pass**

### Quality Gates

**Per-Step Validation**:
- Each step must pass all quality checks before proceeding
- Local tests, builds, and linting must pass before commit
- CI/CD pipeline must complete successfully
- Code review standards met for incremental changes
- No regressions introduced to existing functionality

## Implementation Guidelines

### KISS Principle Application

**Simplicity Focus**:
- Solve the immediate problem with minimal complexity
- Avoid abstractions that aren't immediately needed
- Use direct, straightforward solutions
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions and classes focused and cohesive

**Avoid Over-Engineering**:
- Don't build frameworks for single-use cases
- Avoid premature optimization
- Don't add features not explicitly required
- Keep error handling proportional to actual risks
- Use simple data structures unless complexity justified

### Code Organization

**File and Component Strategy**:
- Modify existing files when possible vs. creating new ones
- Follow established project structure and naming conventions
- Group related functionality logically
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use consistent coding style throughout

## Success Criteria

✅ **Complete when you have**:
- Implemented all core functionality meeting acceptance criteria
- Successfully completed iterative implementation with all pipelines passing
- Followed project conventions and coding standards consistently
- Added appropriate testing with comprehensive coverage
- Maintained code quality throughout all implementation steps
- Verified no regressions in existing functionality
- Used simplest effective approach solving the core problem

## Next Steps

**If implementation complete and all pipelines pass** → Continue to @merge-request-creation@

**If pipeline failures occur during any step** → Follow pipeline debugging procedure:
1. Use `gitlab_get_pipeline_jobs` to identify which specific jobs failed
2. Use `gitlab_get_job_log` to examine detailed failure logs
3. Categorize failure type: compilation, testing, linting, or deployment
4. For compilation failures: Fix syntax or dependency issues locally first
5. For test failures: Run tests locally to reproduce and debug
6. For linting failures: Run linters locally and fix violations
7. For deployment failures: Check configuration and environment issues
8. Fix identified issues completely before pushing again
9. Repeat implementation cycle for the failed step only
10. Never proceed to next step until current step pipeline succeeds

**If implementation proves more complex than expected** → Follow complexity management procedure:
1. Stop current implementation and assess actual vs. expected complexity
2. Break remaining work into additional smaller, logical steps
3. Consider if requirements need clarification or scope reduction
4. Consult with team lead or domain expert for guidance
5. Document complexity increase and reasons in MR comments
6. Adjust timeline expectations and communicate changes to stakeholders
7. Resume implementation with revised step plan
8. Consider creating follow-up issues for future improvements

**If local testing consistently fails** → Follow testing troubleshooting procedure:
1. Verify test environment matches CI/CD environment configuration
2. Clear all caches, temporary files, and reinstall dependencies
3. Check for test-specific environment variables or configuration
4. Run individual test suites to isolate failing components
5. Check for race conditions or timing issues in tests
6. Verify test data setup and cleanup procedures
7. If needed, temporarily skip flaky tests with proper documentation
8. Once tests stabilized, remove skips and ensure full test coverage

## Best Practices

### Technical Excellence
- **Test First**: Always validate locally before committing
- **Small Steps**: Implement incrementally with continuous validation
- **KISS Always**: Choose simplest solution that solves the problem
- **Follow Patterns**: Use existing project conventions and patterns
- **Quality Gates**: Never compromise on testing and pipeline validation

### Process Excellence
- **Plan Steps**: Break work into logical, testable increments
- **Validate Continuously**: Use CI/CD pipeline as mandatory quality gate  
- **Document Progress**: Clear commit messages explaining each step
- **Stay Focused**: Implement only what's needed to meet requirements
- **Prepare for Review**: Ensure code is ready for effective review process
