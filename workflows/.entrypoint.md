# Global Entrypoint Instructions

These instructions apply to all workflow entrypoints and define consistent behavior across the system.

## Context Compaction Behavior

**CRITICAL**: When the conversation context becomes too long and requires compaction:

1. **Always preserve the current step**: Include the full content of the current workflow step you are on
2. **Include progress tracking**: Clearly state:
   - Which workflow you are executing
   - What step you are currently on (step ID and title)
   - What you have completed so far in this step
   - What remains to be done in the current step
3. **Maintain workflow continuity**: Ensure the compacted context allows seamless continuation of the workflow

Example compaction format:
```
Currently executing: [Workflow Name]
Current Step: `@step-id@` - [Step Title]
Progress in current step:
- ‚úÖ Completed: [list of completed actions]
- üîÑ In Progress: [current action being worked on]
- ‚è≥ Remaining: [actions still needed]
```

After the compaction, your first step is to retrieve the full step content by calling `workflow_get_step` with the current step.

## Navigation Instructions

- Use the workflow navigation tools to move between steps
- Always reference steps using the `@step-id@` format
- Maintain context of where you are in the workflow process
- If you encounter errors or blocks, use the workflow tools to find appropriate next steps

## Tool Usage

- Prioritize using workflow-specific tools for navigation and step management
- Use `workflow_get_step` to retrieve detailed step information
- Use `workflow_list_entrypoints` when you need to see available workflows
- Document your progress using the workflow system's built-in tracking

## Error Handling

- If a step cannot be completed, document the blocker clearly
- Use workflow navigation to find alternative paths or error handling steps
- Maintain workflow state even when encountering issues
