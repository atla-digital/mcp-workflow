# Merge Request Creation

Create a comprehensive merge request with detailed documentation, proper configuration, and complete development infrastructure setup.

## Purpose

This step establishes a well-documented, properly configured merge request that enables effective review, testing, and eventual merge into the target branch.

## Prerequisites

- Implementation completed and tested successfully
- All local tests, builds, and quality checks passing
- Feature branch ready with clean commit history
- Clear understanding of requirements and implementation approach

## Merge Request Preparation

### Branch and Infrastructure Setup

**Feature Branch Verification**:
- Ensure feature branch exists and is properly named
- Use `gitlab_create_branch` if branch creation needed
- Verify branch is based on correct target branch (usually main/master)
- Ensure all commits are pushed to remote branch

**Repository State Validation**:
- Confirm working directory is clean with no uncommitted changes
- Verify all implementation commits are included in branch
- Check that branch is synchronized with remote
- Ensure no merge conflicts with target branch

### Comprehensive MR Description

**Description Structure**:

**Problem Statement**:
- Clear description of issue or feature being addressed
- Business context and user impact explanation
- Link to related issues, requirements, or specifications

**Solution Approach**:
- High-level technical approach and architecture decisions
- Key implementation choices and rationale
- Any trade-offs or alternatives considered

**Implementation Details**:
- Overview of code changes and affected components
- New functionality or behavior introduced
- Database migrations, API changes, or breaking changes

**Testing Strategy**:
- Testing approach and coverage details
- Types of tests added (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Manual testing performed and results
- Edge cases and error scenarios covered

**Acceptance Criteria Verification**:
- Explicit verification that each acceptance criterion is met
- Demonstration of how requirements are satisfied
- Screenshots, examples, or test results as appropriate

### MR Configuration

**GitLab MR Creation**:
- Use `gitlab_create_merge_request` with comprehensive details:
  - Clear, descriptive title following project conventions
  - Complete description using prepared content
  - Appropriate source and target branch specification
  - Proper labels for categorization and tracking

**Review and Approval Setup**:
- Assign appropriate reviewers based on code areas affected
- Add domain experts or security reviewers if needed
- Set up approval requirements according to project policies
- Configure merge settings (squash commits, remove source branch)

**Integration Configuration**:
- Link to related issues using proper GitLab syntax
- Reference any dependency or blocking merge requests
- Set up milestone or iteration assignments if applicable
- Configure any automated checks or quality gates

## Quality Assurance Validation

### Pre-Creation Testing

**Comprehensive Test Validation**:
- Run full test suite one final time before MR creation
- Verify all automated quality checks pass (linting, type checking)
- Confirm code coverage meets project standards
- Test functionality in clean environment if possible

**Documentation Review**:
- Ensure all code comments are accurate and helpful
- Verify README or documentation updates are included
- Check that configuration or setup instructions are updated
- Confirm API documentation reflects any changes

### Integration Verification

**Branch Integration Check**:
- Verify branch merges cleanly with target branch
- Test that merged code doesn't break existing functionality
- Confirm no conflicts with other concurrent development
- Validate that CI/CD pipeline passes on target branch merge

## Communication Strategy

### Stakeholder Notification

**Team Communication**:
- Notify relevant team members of MR creation
- Communicate any special review focus areas or concerns
- Highlight any breaking changes or migration requirements
- Share timeline expectations and urgency level

**Review Request Process**:
- Request reviews from appropriate team members
- Provide context for reviewers about implementation approach
- Highlight any areas that need special attention
- Communicate availability for questions or discussions

### Status Updates

**Progress Communication**:
- Plan for regular updates during review process
- Communicate any pipeline failures or issues promptly
- Share timeline updates if review takes longer than expected
- Provide additional context if questions arise during review

## Success Criteria

✅ **Complete when you have**:
- Created comprehensive merge request with detailed description
- Configured all appropriate settings, labels, and reviewers
- Linked to related issues and dependencies properly
- Verified all tests pass and quality checks complete
- Provided clear documentation of implementation approach
- Set up effective communication with reviewers and stakeholders
- Ensured MR is ready for productive review process

## Next Steps

**If MR created successfully and all validations pass** → Continue to @merge-request-finalization@

**If MR creation encounters issues** → Address configuration problems and retry creation process

**If additional documentation or context needed** → Update MR description and notify reviewers

## Best Practices

### Documentation Excellence
- **Complete Context**: Provide comprehensive problem and solution description
- **Clear Rationale**: Explain implementation decisions and trade-offs made
- **Verification Details**: Show how acceptance criteria are satisfied
- **Testing Evidence**: Document testing approach and results clearly

### Configuration Excellence
- **Proper Setup**: Configure all MR settings appropriately for project workflow
- **Right Reviewers**: Include appropriate domain experts and stakeholders
- **Clear Links**: Connect to related issues, dependencies, and documentation
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure all automated checks and validations are enabled

### Communication Excellence
- **Stakeholder Awareness**: Notify relevant team members proactively
- **Context Sharing**: Provide reviewers with implementation context and focus areas
- **Timeline Communication**: Set appropriate expectations for review and merge
- **Responsive Engagement**: Plan for active participation in review discussions
