# Security & Performance Analysis

Conduct focused security and performance analysis as part of comprehensive code review to identify vulnerabilities, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities.

## Purpose

This step provides specialized analysis beyond general code quality to ensure changes are secure, performant, and production-ready while identifying potential risks and optimization opportunities.

## Prerequisites

- Systematic file review completed with documented findings
- Understanding of project security and performance requirements
- Access to security scanning tools and performance benchmarks
- Knowledge of common vulnerability patterns and performance bottlenecks

## Security Analysis Process

### 1. Security Vulnerability Assessment

**Purpose**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities that could compromise system integrity.

**Security Focus Areas**:
- **Input Validation**: Verify all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- **Output Encoding**: Ensure outputs are encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Check access controls and permission enforcement
- **Data Protection**: Verify sensitive data handling and encryption practices
- **Injection Prevention**: Look for SQL, command, or other injection vulnerabilities
- **Error Handling**: Ensure error messages don't leak sensitive information

**Analysis Actions**:
- Review input handling for validation completeness and bypass potential
- Check output generation for proper encoding and escaping
- Validate authentication mechanisms and session management
- Examine authorization checks at all access points
- Look for hardcoded credentials, keys, or sensitive configuration
- Assess cryptographic implementations for proper algorithms and key management

**Success Criteria**:
- No critical or high-severity security vulnerabilities identified
- Input validation covers all user-controlled data paths
- Proper authorization enforced for all protected resources
- Sensitive data handled according to security standards

### 2. Performance Impact Analysis

**Purpose**: Evaluate performance implications of code changes and identify optimization opportunities.

**Performance Focus Areas**:
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Assess time and space complexity of new algorithms
- **Database Efficiency**: Review query performance and database interaction patterns
- **Memory Management**: Check for memory leaks and efficient resource usage
- **Network Optimization**: Evaluate API calls and network communication efficiency
- **Caching Strategy**: Assess caching implementation and effectiveness
- **Resource Cleanup**: Verify proper cleanup of resources and connections

**Analysis Actions**:
- Analyze algorithm complexity and scalability characteristics
- Review database queries for efficiency and potential N+1 problems
- Check memory allocation patterns and garbage collection impact
- Evaluate network call frequency and payload sizes
- Assess caching strategies and cache invalidation logic
- Review resource lifecycle management and cleanup procedures

**Success Criteria**:
- No significant performance regressions introduced
- Algorithm complexity appropriate for expected data sizes
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Memory usage patterns efficient and leak-free
- Network calls minimized and properly cached where appropriate
